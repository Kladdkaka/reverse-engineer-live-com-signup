# part 1

hi there, i am just a average wannabe-reverse engineerer, that want to find out how microsoft prevents people from automating registering live.com accounts, as they seem to have really interested tech for that.

lets get right into it:

the first url is this: https://signup.live.com/

when you click on it in a browser, it will return 302 Found. Set the cookie DID to a number, with a 2~ seconds expiry, and set the new location to a long url. image of it https://i.imgur.com/Z8nW4bM.png

the location it will redirect to looks like this:

https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=13&checkda=1&ct=1511903702&rver=6.7.6655.0&wp=MBI_SSL&wreply=https://signup.live.com/?uaid=3384ebed52354581b048a0469ac4c52a&lic=1&lc=1033&id=68692&mkt=sv-SE&uaid=3384ebed52354581b048a0469ac4c52a

for it to be more readable ill make it into a json object: (https://devutilsonline.com/json/convert-http-query-string-to-json)

```json
{
  "wa": "wsignin1.0",
  "rpsnv": "13",
  "checkda": "1",
  "ct": "1511903702",
  "rver": "6.7.6655.0",
  "wp": "MBI_SSL",
  "wreply": "https%3a%2f%2fsignup.live.com%2f%3fuaid%3d3384ebed52354581b048a0469ac4c52a%26lic%3d1",
  "lc": "1033",
  "id": "68692",
  "mkt": "sv-SE",
  "uaid": "3384ebed52354581b048a0469ac4c52a\r\n"
}
```

to get which ones are unique for each request, i made a fast script:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlsplit, parse_qs
import requests

def get_qs():
    return urlsplit(requests.get('https://signup.live.com/signup', headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36'}).history[0].headers['Location']).query

print()
print(get_qs())
print()
print(get_qs())
print()
```

yes i know it's really bad lol, but who cares :>

btw, i forgot to write it earlier haha, but it seems like if you dont include browser headers it will error

but here is the result:

## 1
```json
{
  "wa": "wsignin1.0",
  "rpsnv": "13",
  "checkda": "1",
  "ct": "1511904524",
  "rver": "6.7.6655.0",
  "wp": "MBI_SSL",
  "wreply": "https%3a%2f%2fsignup.live.com%2fsignup%3fuaid%3d069af246416f4e3caabcd95c8a4b804f%26lic%3d1",
  "lc": "1033",
  "id": "68692",
  "mkt": "en-US",
  "uaid": "069af246416f4e3caabcd95c8a4b804f"
}
```

## 2
```json
{
  "wa": "wsignin1.0",
  "rpsnv": "13",
  "checkda": "1",
  "ct": "1511904525",
  "rver": "6.7.6655.0",
  "wp": "MBI_SSL",
  "wreply": "https%3a%2f%2fsignup.live.com%2fsignup%3fuaid%3d13ce11d76e964240af9d13d0584f9224%26lic%3d1",
  "lc": "1033",
  "id": "68692",
  "mkt": "en-US",
  "uaid": "13ce11d76e964240af9d13d0584f9224"
}
```

this is interesting. but from playing around with it, it seems like it's this way!

```js
{
  "wa": "wsignin1.0", // what method you are calling? [persistant]
  "rpsnv": "13", // no idea [persistant]
  "checkda": "1", // no idea [persistant]
  "ct": "1511904525", // this is interesting, it's going up with every request, but if you wait a bit it will go up multiple, i guess it's some type of page load count [changes]
  "rver": "6.7.6655.0", // first i thought chrome version, but nope, seems like it is somewhat persistant [idk]
  "wp": "MBI_SSL", // dont know, but think it is if you are using ssl or not [persistant]
  "wreply": "https%3a%2f%2fsignup.live.com%2fsignup%3fuaid%3d13ce11d76e964240af9d13d0584f9224%26lic%3d1", // https://signup.live.com/signup?uaid={{uaid}}&lic=1 [changes] this seems interesting, will write more soon
  "lc": "1033", // no idea [persistant] i think
  "id": "68692", // no idea [persistant] i think
  "mkt": "en-US", // language, mkt = market?
  "uaid": "13ce11d76e964240af9d13d0584f9224" // uaid, unique, [changes], same as in wreply
}
```

when you call the url, it will return 302 found again, and change url to the one in wreply (i believe, check later)

it will also set these cookies

```
Set-Cookie:MSPRequ=lt=1511903702&id=68692&co=1; secure= ;path=/;HTTPOnly=;version=1
Set-Cookie:uaid=3384ebed52354581b048a0469ac4c52a; domain=login.live.com;secure= ;path=/;HTTPOnly= ;version=1
```

when you go to the url it redirects to, then you are on the next stage! go to next file <3
