# part 2

hi again! now we are at the next stage, lets get right into the news! (im so sorry)

okay the url will be like this https://signup.live.com/?uaid=3384ebed52354581b048a0469ac4c52a&lic=1

uaid is obviously the id, but what is lic?

my idea is that we first diff the url twice, but to see what gets difference on each requests, we start with https://signup.live.com/ if that makes sense

that is lic 1 & lic 1, so pretty obvious what changes, but lets do the same, but set lic 0 for one, and 1 for the other one.

cant see any obvious difference (but i made mistake to use same uaid so rip, but it's w/e)

so the interesting lines are these

first one is behavioralTelemetryUrl, so smartscreen, its a js file, it seems like it sends statistics to microsoft, from mouse bindings etc, but i dont think it's part of the anti bot tech so ill skip it

hip (hip.url & hip.fid), this seems interesting, seems like it is a unique link to a js file for that session only?

uaid is self explainatory

apiCanary & tcxt some type of api key stuff?

randomNum um o_O

ill focus on hip next file
